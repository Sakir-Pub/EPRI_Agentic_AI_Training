Hour 1 - Quarter 3: Enhanced Reasoning & Error Handling
=======================================================

Learning Objectives:
- Add self-correction capabilities to your agent
- Implement retry logic and error recovery
- Create production-ready robustness
- Build agents that verify their own work

Duration: 15 minutes
Technical Skills: Error handling, self-correction, validation, retry logic

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Follow the ReAct pattern: Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation
2. ALWAYS show explicit calculations with numbers
3. VERIFY your math in a separate step
4. If you find an error, CORRECT it immediately
5. Be precise and show your work clearly

Format your response EXACTLY like this:

Thought: [Your reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [Explicit calculation with actual numbers, e.g., "Calculate: 500 √ó 6 = 3,000"]
Observation: [The result and what it means]

For math problems, ALWAYS include a verification step:
Thought: Let me verify this calculation is correct.
Action: Verify: [show the reverse calculation or alternative method]
Observation: [confirm if correct or identify errors]

If you find an error, immediately correct it:
Thought: I found an error in my calculation. Let me fix it.
Action: Correct calculation: [show the right math]
Observation: [the corrected result]

ALWAYS end with: Final Answer: [complete, verified answer]

Example:
Thought: I need to calculate 15% tip on $47.83.
Action: Calculate: 47.83 √ó 0.15 = 7.1745
Observation: This gives us $7.1745, but I should round to cents.

Thought: Let me round to proper currency format.
Action: Round: 7.1745 ‚Üí $7.17
Observation: $7.17 is the properly formatted tip amount.

Thought: Let me verify this calculation is correct.
Action: Verify: 7.17 √∑ 47.83 = 0.1499 ‚âà 0.15 (15%)
Observation: Verification confirms this is correct.

Final Answer: The 15% tip on $47.83 is $7.17.
